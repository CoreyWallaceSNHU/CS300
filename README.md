**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**  
In the first project of this course, the objective was to enhance pseudocode to meet the requirements of the Computer Science department at ABC University (ABCU). This project focused on two primary tasks: generating a list of Computer Science courses sorted in alphanumeric order and providing detailed information, including prerequisites, for a specified course. The tasks included drafting pseudocode for file operations, constructing course objects, developing a menu system, and sorting and displaying course listings. An important consideration was assessing the runtime and memory efficiency of various data structures—such as vectors, hash tables, and trees—to identify the most suitable option for program implementation. This evaluation process involved analyzing Big O notation and weighing the advantages and disadvantages of each structure. 

 For the second project, the aim is to develop a command-line program in C++ that proficiently manages and interacts with course data. This includes creating code for reading course information from a file and storing it within the selected data structure. The program will feature a user-friendly menu with options for loading data, displaying an alphanumeric list of courses, retrieving specific course information, and allowing users to exit the program. Additionally, the code must adhere to industry-standard best practices, incorporating elements such as error handling, in-line documentation, and meaningful naming conventions to promote clarity and ease of maintenance. 

 
**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**  
A structured approach to project management is essential for successfully completing tasks. It is vital to thoroughly analyze project requirements, reference previous work, create pseudocode for each data structure, and conduct a Big O analysis to assess runtime efficiency. Weighing the advantages and disadvantages of each data structure helps in making well-informed decisions. Proficiency in data structures plays a critical role in these projects, as they impact algorithm design, memory usage, time complexity, and solutions tailored to specific problems. This expertise facilitates optimal decision-making and ensures the ability to adapt to evolving project demands, leading to solutions that are both well-optimized and efficient. 

 
**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?** 
To address any challenges that arise, I find it beneficial to take breaks after prolonged screen time in order to gain a fresh perspective. If this strategy does not prove effective, I make use of online student services, specifically the 24/7 drop-in tutoring, which allows me to connect with a tutor who can cater to my specific needs. Moreover, if I require additional support, I reach out to my professor when the issue remains unresolved with my tutor’s assistance. 


**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**  
Participating in these projects has greatly expanded my understanding of software design and program development. This experience has enabled me to view projects from a comprehensive perspective, taking into account both the code and the essential elements of architecture and user experience. 

 
**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**  
Participating in these projects during my junior year in college has significantly transformed my approach to programming. I've come to prioritize essential principles such as creating code that is maintainable, readable, and adaptable. Throughout this experience, I have noted a clear evolution in my programming methods.  

 I have adopted modular design techniques that allow me to decompose complex tasks into smaller, more manageable components. This shift has led to a more organized and maintainable codebase. I've also recognized the importance of clear and consistent naming conventions, which not only enhance my understanding but also facilitate collaboration with others.  

 Documentation has become a crucial practice, with well-placed comments providing clarity regarding code logic and decision-making. Moreover, utilizing version control tools like Git has simplified collaboration efforts and improved version management, which are vital skills in team-based development settings.  

 I've also learned the value of testing and test-driven development, which help in identifying errors early and ensuring code quality. Refactoring has emerged as a key strategy for enhancing my code, allowing me to maintain both readability and efficiency over time.  

 The evolving nature of the projects has encouraged me to design solutions with adaptability in mind, making it easier to incorporate necessary changes or updates. Additionally, implementing robust error-handling mechanisms has proven essential for boosting program reliability. Engaging in code reviews has provided insights into diverse perspectives and coding practices, aligning with industry standards and sharpening my capacity to write clean and maintainable code. 

 Ultimately, this project has not only achieved its immediate objectives but has also equipped me with valuable skills that will shape my programming career moving forward.
